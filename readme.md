##Triad NC Startups

We know things are fairly spartan over there at the moment but, we are working
to grow a community of hard working and hard playing entrepreneurs to share ideas
and build companies to benefit the Triad.

Any idea is a good idea so if you feel kind and want to help out, feel free to jump
to the contributor section
